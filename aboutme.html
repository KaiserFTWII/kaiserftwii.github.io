									<h3 class="major">Intro</h3>
									<p>
										I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada and have lived here my whole life. As mentioned on the home page, I am currently enrolled at the University of Toronto and, more specifically, will be heading into my third year in Civil Engineering. Now, you might be thinking to yourself: why does a student in
										engineering have their own portfolio? What could they possibly fill it with? Well, that's where the second part of the above sentence plays in: my ambitions.
									</p>

									<p>
										Growing up, I was never really quite sure what I wanted to do with my life. I had (and still do have) hopes of becoming a doctor or entering the pharmaceutical industry, since I love helping people. Whether it's a project at school or activities outside of education, I'm always eager to help others with
										what they need. As I got older, though, it became time for me to figure out what I wanted to do in life. Through various hobbies and extra-curriculars, I soon realized what I was interested in.
									</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Interests and Hobbies</h3>
									<p>
										During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, I fell in love with soccer and became engrossed in the sport, thinking that this might be what I might have wanted to do. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that I wasn't the most athletic person and probably wouldn't make it in any sport standing at a solid 5' 4" (165 cm).
										Though I still love sport, I decided to look at different hobbies that were more my speed. A few years later, I was introduced to video games, which changed my life forever (I know, I know cliche, but very true).
									</p>

									<p>
										As I started to play more games, the more I became interested in coding and other technical software. It was always fascinating playing different games and realizing that behind all of the flashy physics, there's some form of code running to make it all happen. When I finally took coding classes in high school,
										I got a handle of most of the basics of Java (except recursion) and continued my coding throughout high school. During that time, I became more proficient in Java and had a look at both HTML and CSS. I learned Python in my first year of university and attempted to learn C++ and the Tkinter package for Python.
									</p>

									<p>
										Near the end of my second year of university, I started messing around in blender and got here. I followed a few tutorials online and these are the projects you will see on the Projects page. My journey in 3D Modelling has just begun and I look forward to seeing where it takes me.
										Throughout all of this, another question may have popped into your head: this is cool and all, but why civil engineering if you're interested in coding, 3D modelling and other software? In short, I think civil engineering as a discipline is quite interesting, especially when one thinks about how
										every single building around them was approved and had its construction facilitated by civil engineering. Furthermore, I want to see how technology becomes more intertwined with the industry and what the future holds in store.
