									<p>
										To continue where I left off from the home page, I am, specifically, in my third year of study at the University of Toronto,
										pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science and Engineering, with a major in Civil Engineering. Ever since high school, I was interested
										in the role of coding in an advancing society, especially regarding artifical intelligence and more intelligent cities. My focus
										shifted towards civil engineering as I became more exposed to the industry. I started noticing more construction projects around my area
										such as <a href="https://www.stclairvillage.com/" target="_blank">condo development going on nearby</a>. I also started to watch more
										programs about residential properties and saw how houses can be modelled in 3D softwares before a single piece of dirt is excavated.
										These models became more intiguing and I also developed a bit of interest in construction when looking at such models.
									</p>
									<p>
										My curiosity led me to where I am today. Over the past few years, I have accumulated a number of software skills which can be applied
										to the industry and have expanded my horizons reagrding software in civil engineering. I am eager to expand them further and excited
										to see what the future holds!

												<h3>Project Overview</h3>
												<p>
													This porfolio includes some of the techincal skills I have developed over the years, including 3D modelling (AutoCAD, SketchUP)
													and structural analysis (SAP2000). This section gives a brief overview of what I did to develop these skills and how they represent
													what I want to do in the future.
												</p>
												<h4>AutoCAD and SketchUP</h4>
												<p>
													Within the <a href="civ235.html" target="_blank">engineering graphics</a> section, you can find some of the projects I worked on
													when learning more about AutoCAD and SketchUP. To be brief, I learned the fundamentals of using AutoCAD to create 2D models and
													using SketchUP to create 3D models. Objects designed in these software include steel plates, box girder segments and contour elevations.
													Learning these software helped me understand how construction plans are created, going from a rough sketch to a 2D model and, eventually,
													to a 3D visualiztion.
												</p>
												<h4>SAP2000</h4>
												<p>
													In the <a href="steeldesign.html" target="_blank">steel design</a> section, I outline the skills I developed in SAP2000 and general
													steel design to help create a four storey office building in North York, Ontario, Canada. During this process, I learned the basics
													of inputting different properties in SAP2000 and using load combinations to determine the governing loads and section design. Learning
													about SAP2000 helped me realize the importance of being able to do structural analysis calculations quickly. If everything was done by
													hand, it would take ages to be able to analyze every different possible scenario and determine what the governing load is.
												</p>
												<h4>Blender</h4>
												<p>
													The <a href="blender.html" target="_blank">blender</a> section contains some of the tutorial projects which I completed to understand
													the basics of the modelling software. I decided to give blender a shot during the COVID-19 pandemic to develop skills in a more "creative"
													software, in which I could learn some aspects of the designing side of civil engineering. This mostly applies to real estate and home
													development, but I thought it would be nice to have some of this knowledge in case I would like to pursue a career in that field.
