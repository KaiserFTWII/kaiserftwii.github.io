										<h2>Summary</h2>
										<p>
											There were three main parts to this course: AutoCAD, SketchUP and freehand drawings. AutoCAD was used to create 2D drawings and creating dimensions for given drawings. SketchUP was used for 3D modelling different civil engineering aspects. Lastly, simple freehand techniques were taught to that students can create rough drafts quickly and accurately

											Over the course of the semester, I developed an understanding of the basic components of 2D drawing in AutoCAD. At the start of the year, our assignments mainly involved being given a set of engineering drawings with specific dimensions to replicate in AutoCAD (Click <a href="images/AutoCAD Assignment 1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> for an image of one of the earlier projcts). This was done using a basic set of 2D drawing tools, polyline and 2D arcs. We were given a .dwg template to use to ensure that proper layer usage. This involved determining which parts of the drawing
											were going to be in the foreground and what may be in the background/hidden. Finally, the last basic part of AutoCAD we learned was how to properly dimension objects. There were two main points that were taught for this part: what dimension to use and which ones are redundant. In regards to the first point, we looked at how to properly dimension straight and curved objects to ensure maximum clarity. This can be seen on the left image; with the curved dimensions, some of the curves required one to figure out the actual length and then use angular dimensions instead of aligned
											dimensions, since it would convey more clarity. In terms of the second point, we learned about what parts of the model where dimensions were redundant, such as modelling half of a symmetrical shape. As the year progressed, the projects became more advanced and we eventually learned to create and dimension <a href="images/AutoCAD Assignment 7.jpg" target="_blank">contours</a> and learned how to dimension more complex shape, as seen by the final project on the left.

											Another software that we learned during the semester was SketchUP, which was used to create 3D models. Similar to AutoCAD, we were asked to create a model from a set of engineering drawings with given dimensions. We started off with the basics by creating <a href="images/SketchUp Assignment 1.jpg" target="_blank">simple box girders</a>. This involved setting up gridlines to create proper measurements and adding lines where needed. After creating the models, we additionally created scenes for use in LayOut. To do this, we first had to check whether the model was in parallel-projection or perspective view to
											make sure that it was clearly visible within the scene required. For example, if a plan view was required, we would need a parallel-projection view since it would only show the lines, rather than having part of the model in the background, which is the case with perspective. Once we got a handle on the basics, we began to look at more complex models such as the one on the right and <a href="images/SketchUp Assignment 5.jpg" target="_blank">steel plates</a>. After making several physical 3D models of girders and plates, we also looked at how to create <a href="images/SketchUp Assignment 7.jpg" target="_blank">
											contour elevations</a> and create different <a href="images/SketchUp Assignment 7 Plan View.jpg" target="_blank">views</a>.
										</p>
										<h3 style="text-align: left">Freehand Drawings</h3>
										<p><a href="images/Freehand Assessment.jpg" target="_blank"><span class="image left"><img src="images/Freehand Assessment.jpg" alt=""/></a></span>
											The last main part of this graphics course is freehand sketching. Although the softwares above can draw these models for us very accurately with proper dimensions, it's good to develop skecthing skills so that we can quickly create rough drafts. This component of the course taught us how to swiftly draw fairly authentic shapes, such as <a href="" target="_blank">rectangles</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">circles</a>, and <a href="" target="_blank">parabolas</a>. We then extended these basic drawings and combined them to create more complex shapes, such as <a href="" target="_blank">cylinders</a>. Once we got
											the basics down, we began to draw objects which we might find on the construction site, such as the box girder segments seen on the left.
