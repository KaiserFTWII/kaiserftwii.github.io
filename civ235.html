										<h2>Summary</h2>
										<p>
											There were three main parts to this course: AutoCAD, SketchUP and freehand drawings. AutoCAD was used to create 2D drawings and creating dimensions for given drawings. SketchUP was used for 3D modelling different civil engineering aspects. Lastly, simple freehand techniques were taught to that students can create rough drafts quickly and accurately

											The latest project that I finished was recreating this couch from Zanotta. Similar to the Fredericia chair below, I watched a tutorial and followed along. The couch can originally found at the <a href="https://www.zanotta.it/en-us/products/sofas/william" target="_blank">Zanotta Website</a>, where you can also find the blueprints from which to model from. This was also the first project where I explored the physics tab, specifically cloth simulations. Using these simluations, I was able to generally figure out how various aspects of the tab worked, such as pressure and gravity.
											I also messed around with the collisions tab and figured out how to reduce the gap between two objects colliding and reducing the friction between two objects. This was also the first time working with multiple UV maps on the same object; the side pillows and back seating both had seams on the sides, which was introduced via another texture map in addition to the main fabric texture like the rest of the couch. The pillow and blanket textures can be found at <a href="https://www.poliigon.com/" target="_blank">poliigon.com</a>

										<h3 style="text-align: right">Fredericia Søborg Chair*</h3>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Final Chair Model.png" alt="" /></span>
											The Søborg chair is the first project where I modelled something with existing blueprints, which can be found at the <a href="https://www.fredericia.com/products/by-designer-b%C3%B8rge-mogensen/s%C3%B8borg-wood-base-1.aspx?PID=63&catid=6219" target="_blank">Frederecia website</a>. This model came from a tutorial which outlined the basics of modelling an existing object, which explained how to create a cooperative mesh, setting seams for UV unwrapping so that they aren't obvious and edge flow. One of the trickiest parts of this whole project was creating the backrest and
											modelling curved surfaces in general. The backrest was quite difficult due to its rotation, which quickly became an issue when looking at the blueprints provided. If the backrest was modelled via the front and top, it wouldn't look right from the side. To resolve this issue, I modelled it straight on (no rotation) and then rotated it to match the anlge on the side. Though I couldn't replicate it exactly, the difference aren't major and the curve still remains smooth enough to act as a backrest. I also learned a bit about how to set up studio lighting. This includes
											creating an infinite background (creating a plane, extruding it and creating bevels), creating a dual lighting system to highlight certain parts of the chair and introducing ambient occlusion to make shadows more realistic.

										<h3>Donut Animation</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Final Donut Animation.gif"></span>
											The very first project which I undertook was, as expected, a tutorial outlining most of the basics of blender. As can be seen, I followed the donut tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice" target="_blank">Blender Guru</a> on Youtube. The tutorial went over everything from modelling to sculpting to keyframe animation. I learned how to create models in blender, both from scratch (the donut and the plate) and from a reference image (the cup). The tutorial also went over sculpting and texture painting, which helped give the donut it's realistic features,
											such as the icing and the indented middle band going around the donut with a ligther shade. I also learned about nodes in the shading tab and used it to make the donut more lifelike, by using mixRGB nodes to play around with the colour and multiple displacement nodes to add bumps. Additionally, I imported a couple of textures from <a href="https://www.poliigon.com/" target="_blank">poliigon.com</a> for the background and marble table to emulate the look and feel of a cafe. Fianlly, I added some lighting and created an empty axis on the donut to focus the camera on. This allowed
											me to start with the donut and plate out of frame and rotate it into view and change the focus of the camera. To create the animation, I used keyframes, rendered and image sequence and put it together in blender's video editing tab. Let the journey begin!
